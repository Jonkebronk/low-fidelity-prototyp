# Personas

## Overview
Two personas were developed based on qualitative interviews with 5 respondents (ages 27-83) living in rural Norrbotten. Analysis revealed two distinct user clusters based on digital proficiency, information-seeking behavior, and primary needs.

## Primary Persona: Erik Lindqvist

### Demographics
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age | 27 years |
| Gender | Male |
| Occupation | Sports store employee |
| Living situation | Single, lived in village entire life |
| Location | Rural village, Norrbotten |

### Quote
> "Det är svårt att veta vad man kan lita på när det är mycket hörsägen. Information om byn, av dom som bor i byn."
> 
> *"It's hard to know what to trust when there's so much hearsay. Info about the village, from those who live in the village."*

### Goals
1. **Quick access** to reliable local information
2. **Centralized source** instead of scattered Facebook groups
3. **Trustworthy info** - know where data comes from
4. Access to **hunting/fishing** and outdoor activity info

### Behaviors
- Uses Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram daily
- Gets local info from multiple Facebook groups
- Often gives up on slow/clunky services
- Calls a friend when digital services fail
- Prefers mobile over desktop

### Pain Points
- Information scattered across 5+ Facebook groups
- Unreliable mobile internet connection
- Too many clicks to find simple information
- Can't verify if information is accurate or current
- Municipal websites are slow and complex

### Technical Proficiency
| Skill | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Social media | 95% |
| Mobile apps | 90% |
| Web browsing | 85% |
| Patience with bad UX | 25% |

### Scenario
Erik is at home on a Saturday morning, wondering if there are any local events happening this weekend. He opens Facebook and scrolls through three different community groups, finding conflicting information about a market. Frustrated, he texts his friend to ask what's actually happening. A centralized information screen at the village center would let him quickly verify event details on his way to work.

### Design Implications
- **Centralized info source** - all content in one place
- **Source attribution** - show where data comes from
- **Fast performance** - optimize for poor connectivity
- **Quick scanning** - large text, clear hierarchy
- **Mobile-first** - responsive design essential

## Secondary Persona: Gunnel Bergström

### Demographics
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age | 78 years |
| Gender | Female |
| Occupation | Retired (former childcare worker) |
| Living situation | Widow, lives alone with home care assistance |
| Location | Rural village, Norrbotten |

### Quote
> "Informationen kommer över en, man behöver inte söka sig till det. Undviker digitala tjänster som är sega eller röriga."
>
> *"Information just comes to me - I don't need to go looking for it. I avoid digital services if they're slow or messy."*

### Goals
1. **Stay informed** without technology struggles
2. **Find bus times** independently (without app or help)
3. **Maintain independence** - not rely on son/neighbors for info
4. Know about **local events** and community happenings

### Behaviors
- Gets information from son, neighbors, home care staff
- Watches TV news (SVT) daily
- Uses basic smartphone for calls and simple texts
- Avoids services requiring login or multiple steps
- Prefers information to "come to her" passively

### Pain Points
- Services requiring multiple logins/passwords
- Small text on websites and apps
- Complex navigation on municipal sites
- Feeling dependent on others for simple information
- Missing community events because she didn't hear about them

### Technical Proficiency
| Skill | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Basic smartphone (calls/SMS) | 45% |
| Social media | 20% |
| Web browsing | 30% |
| Traditional media (TV/radio) | 90% |

### Scenario
Gunnel needs to take the bus to Boden for a doctor's appointment tomorrow. She doesn't have the bus app and finds the regional transport website confusing. Usually, she asks her son to look it up, but he's traveling. A public information screen near her home would let her check tomorrow's bus schedule with a simple tap - large text, clear times, no login required.

### Design Implications
- **Passive viewing mode** - info visible without interaction
- **Extra large text** - 24pt minimum for key info
- **High contrast** - 7:1 ratio for readability
- **Simple navigation** - minimal steps to find info
- **No login required** - completely friction-free
- **Bus schedule priority** - prominent placement

---

## Persona Prioritization

| Aspect | Erik (Primary) | Gunnel (Secondary) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Usage frequency | Daily | Weekly |
| Technical barriers | Low | High |
| Alternative solutions | Many (phone, apps) | Few (depends on others) |
| Impact of solution | Convenience | Independence |

**Erik is primary** because he represents the larger user group and will use the screen more frequently. However, **Gunnel's needs drive accessibility requirements** that benefit all users - the "curb cut effect."
